# PPT brief — SIH26080 idea-submission deck

Slide-by-slide content for the team building the PPT. Follows the official `templates-and-examples/SIH2026-IDEA-Presentation-Format.pptx` and copies the layout patterns of `templates-and-examples/sih_winning.pdf` (Visioncraft, PS 25159).

Facts come from `../PRD.md` and `../TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`. Nothing is built yet, so **no measured results exist**. Every number below is a definition, threshold or design target from those two files. Do not add a skill score, "% improvement" or latency figure.

**Graphics:** Mermaid sources for every diagram are in `PPT_DIAGRAMS.md`. Render them at https://mermaid.live and restyle in the deck. The flow diagram on slide 3 is the reference for the main graphic.

## Slide 2 — Proposed solution

**Slide title (top, centred):** RegimeRain: Classify the Weather Regime First, Then Correct the Rainfall
**Sub-heading (template):** Proposed Solution (Describe your Idea/Solution/Prototype)

### Left: five pill boxes (red = highlighted phrase)

1. Raw NWP rainfall forecasts err **differently on different days**: active monsoon, break spell, depression, orographic and coastal rain. **One global bias-correction curve** averages that structure away.
2. Our system first **predicts the weather regime** from forecast-time inputs only (forecast rainfall, 850 hPa wind, moisture flux convergence, MJO phase, terrain masks), so it is **deployable, not a hindsight label**.
3. It then applies **a bias correction fitted to that regime** (per-regime empirical quantile mapping) with a **tail rule that keeps heavy-rain values** instead of clipping them.
4. A **calibrated exceedance model** gives the probability of **heavy (≥64.5 mm/day)** and **very-heavy (≥124.5 mm/day)** rainfall, the IMD operational thresholds.
5. Output is a **district-level table and map** an officer can act on, plus a **verification report with all six metrics the PS names: RMSE, ETS, CSI, POD, FAR, FSS**, raw vs corrected, under **leave-one-monsoon-out** testing.

### Right: icon-hub infographic

Centre icon: India map with rain cloud. Six icons around it, each with a two-line label:

| Position | Label |
|---|---|
| Top-left | Regime Classifier (active / break / depression / coastal / orographic) |
| Top-right | Per-Regime Bias Correction |
| Mid-left | Heavy-Rain Probability (calibrated) |
| Mid-right | District Table and Map |
| Bottom-left | Six-Metric Verification Report |
| Bottom-right | Forecast-Time Inputs Only (no leakage) |

### "Innovation and uniqueness" strip (template pointer, one line under the pills or as a 6th slim pill)

**Uniqueness = rigour, not a new algorithm:** classify-then-correct, all six PS metrics, a leakage-proof split, and reported failure cases. State it this way. Do not write "novel AI breakthrough".

## Slide 3 — Technical approach

**Slide title:** TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Left column: Techstack used

1. Python (xarray, zarr, NumPy)
2. LightGBM (regime classifier + exceedance models)
3. scikit-learn (isotonic calibration, metrics)
4. Empirical quantile mapping (custom, per regime per season)
5. GeoPandas (district area-weighted aggregation)
6. FastAPI (serves run artefacts)
7. MapLibre GL (district map + scorecard)
8. Open data: WeatherBench2 (ERA5, IFS HRES), CHIRPS 2.0, IBTrACS, MJO RMM, NOAA GFS

Logos row (as in winning deck): Python, LightGBM, scikit-learn, FastAPI, MapLibre.

Below the stack, template-style lines:
- **Prototype:** *(link, only if one exists by submission; otherwise delete the line)*
- **Prototype video link:** *(same rule)*

### Right: flow diagram (draw as boxes and arrows, like the winning deck)

Top row, left to right:

1. **Inputs**: forecast (IFS HRES / NOAA GFS), ERA5, CHIRPS, IBTrACS, MJO RMM, terrain + coast masks
2. **Ingestion**: clip to India box (6–38°N, 68–98°E), 0.25° grid, mm/day, UTC day
3. **Regime labelling** *(offline, training only)*: active/break rainfall-anomaly index (±1σ, ≥3 days), depression flag from IBTrACS, static coastal/orographic masks. Precedence: depression > orographic > coastal > active/break > other

Middle: **Regime classifier** (multi-class LightGBM, forecast-time features only) outputs a **probability per regime**. A rule override keeps the static coastal/orographic masks.

The classifier output splits into two parallel branches:

- **Branch A: Per-regime quantile mapping.** Fit one curve per regime per season. Top-decile ratio extrapolation for values above the training range. Output: **corrected rainfall grid**.
- **Branch B: Exceedance model.** Two GBM classifiers (heavy, very-heavy), isotonic calibration. Output: **P(heavy), P(very-heavy) grid**.

Both branches join, then:

- **District aggregation.** Area-weighted mean **and** max per district (mean can hide a local heavy cell). Output: **district table + choropleth map**.
- **Verification module.** RMSE, ETS, CSI, POD, FAR, FSS (25 km and 50 km) for **raw vs corrected**, at both thresholds, plus reliability diagram. Output: **verification report**.

Feedback loop (mirror the winning deck's "continuous learning" loop box):
**Verification report → weak regimes / low-sample regimes flagged → refit curves and classifier → re-verify.**

Add a small labelled bracket around the flow: "Leave-one-monsoon-out CV: each June–September season held out whole, so no season leaks into its own training."

## Slide 4 — Feasibility and viability

**Slide title:** FEASIBILITY AND VIABILITY

Table, three columns exactly as the winning deck (cyan | red | pink):

| Analysis of the feasibility of the idea | Potential challenges and risks | Strategies for overcoming these challenges |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical: Achievable** | Rare regimes (e.g. depression) have few historical days, so the quantile curve is noisy | Tabular-scale **LightGBM + empirical quantile mapping** (trains in minutes, no GPU). **Report the sample count behind every regime curve**. Blend the top-2 regimes near transitions if time allows |
| **Data: Available and open** | NCMRWF's NCUM/NEPS-G output is not public. IMD gridded rainfall may not be reachable | Validate on **open IFS HRES + ERA5 with CHIRPS truth**. Provide an **adapter interface for NCUM**. IMD gridded rainfall is a drop-in truth upgrade if reachable, not a dependency |
| **Accuracy: Verifiable** | Bias-correction gains are typically small. Regime labels can leak hindsight into a forecast-time model | **Leave-one-monsoon-out CV**. A **unit test rejects any truth-derived feature**. All six metrics reported, **including where correction does not help** |
| **Operational: Practical** | District-boundary licence. Pipeline must run quickly for daily use | Use **GADM** boundaries with attribution (licence checked). **No retraining in daily mode**: load fitted models, run correction, aggregation and verification only |

Bottom text, same style as the winning deck:

Given that feasibility and viability are our top priority, we will keep everything:

- **Technically viable:** proven, open-source tools (LightGBM, xarray, FastAPI), no deep model, no GPU.
- **Economically feasible:** 100% open data, runs on a laptop or a small cloud VM.
- **Operationally practical:** one pipeline, fixed seeds and hashed models, every output traceable to a run artefact, district table a disaster-management officer can read.

## Slide 5 — Impact and benefits

**Slide title:** IMPACT AND BENEFITS

Keep all claims qualitative. No invented percentages. Wording is "expected" or "supports", never "achieves".

### Left panel (pink): Potential impact on target audience

1. **NCMRWF / IMD forecasters**
   - See which regime was predicted and which correction was applied, so every change is auditable.
   - Get skill against raw NWP on the six metrics they already use.
2. **District disaster-management officers**
   - Read corrected rainfall and heavy-rain probability per district in mm/day.
   - Mean and max per district show localised heavy cells.
3. **State agencies (water, flood, agriculture, urban)**
   - Better-targeted heavy and very-heavy rainfall guidance at district scale.
4. **Model developers and researchers**
   - Per-regime error curves show where NWP fails, feeding model improvement.
5. **Scientific reviewers**
   - Leakage-proof split and reported failure cases make the results trustworthy.

### Right panel (cyan): Benefits of the solution

1. **Social**
   - Earlier, sharper warning of heavy rain for at-risk districts.
   - Clear probability, not just a rainfall number, supports evacuation and response decisions.
2. **Economic**
   - Fewer losses from missed heavy-rain events and from false alarms.
   - Zero data cost: all inputs are open.
3. **Environmental**
   - Runs on tabular models on a laptop, so low compute and energy.
   - Better flood and landslide preparedness in orographic and coastal belts.
4. **Technological**
   - Reusable classify-then-correct pipeline for any NWP model.
   - Reproducible runs (fixed seed, hashed models, manifest file).
5. **Strategic**
   - Supports MoES/NCMRWF post-processing goals with an NCUM-ready adapter.
   - Open methods that can be extended to other regions and seasons.

### Bottom row: three visuals (like the winning deck's chart, pie and image)

1. **Conceptual chart, labelled "Illustrative, not measured":** two quantile-mapping curves. One flat grey line "single global curve", and three coloured lines "active / break / depression". Shows why one curve mis-corrects.
2. **IMD threshold ladder:** vertical bar with two marks, **Heavy ≥ 64.5 mm/day** and **Very heavy ≥ 124.5 mm/day**. Caption: "The events our exceedance probability targets."
3. **District product mockup:** small India map with a few district polygons shaded by heavy-rain probability and one table row (`district | corrected mean | corrected max | P(heavy) | P(very heavy)`). Use placeholders or clearly dummy shading. Caption: "Output format".

## Hard rules for whoever builds the deck

1. **No invented numbers.** Allowed: 64.5 and 124.5 mm/day, 0.25°, 5 km, six metric names, 25/50 km FSS radii, ±1σ, ≥3 days. Anything else needs a source in `../PRD.md` or `../TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`.
2. **Do not write** "novel", "breakthrough", or any improvement percentage. The claim is rigour: six metrics, leakage-proof split, failure cases reported.
3. **Say CHIRPS, not IMD**, for truth. IMD gridded rainfall is unconfirmed.
4. **Say we validate on open models** (IFS HRES, ERA5). Do not imply NCUM/NEPS-G was used.
5. Say "probability-weighted regime blend" only if it is a stated stretch goal, never as a shipped feature.
6. No live-demo content, team-planning notes, or references to other PS numbers on any slide.
7. Keep the winning deck's density: max about 5 pills or 5 numbered groups per slide, one line each where possible.
8. Export PDF, check it is at most 6 pages, and that the "Important Pointers" slide is gone.
